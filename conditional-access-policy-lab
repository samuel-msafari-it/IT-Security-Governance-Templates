## Zero Trust Logic: Startup Baseline Architecture

Our security posture relies on a 'Never Trust, Always Verify' gatekeeper. 

**Policy Logic:**
1. **Condition:** User attempting to access Corporate Cloud Resourse such as 'Financial Apps' or 'GitHub'.
2. **Gate 1:** Is the device Managed and Compliant (Intune)? -> If No, Block.
3. **Gate 2:** Is the IP from an approved/known 'Geolocation' (e.g., Kenya/US/UK)? -> If No, Block.
4. **Gate 3:** Is the Sign-in Risk 'Low'? -> If Medium/High, Require **Hardware-Key MFA**.
5. **Action:** Grant limited-duration session.
