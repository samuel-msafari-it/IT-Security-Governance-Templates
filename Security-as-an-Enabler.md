**Security as an Enabler**
**Philosophy: The Transparent Safety Net**
At a hyper-growth fintech, security is often perceived as a friction point that slows down engineering and product cycles. My approach flips this narrative: Security is a growth engine. By building a foundational infrastructure that is automated and "invisible," we allow Rain’s builders to move at high velocity without the fear of compromising the stablecoin ecosystem.

**1. Reducing Cognitive Load for Employees**
- Automated Identity: By leveraging SCIM/SAML for zero-touch provisioning, we ensure employees have exactly what they need on Day 1, eliminating the "ticket-waiting" period and boosting immediate productivity.

- Hardware-Key Simplicity: Moving away from complex, rotating passwords to Hardware-Based Authentication (YubiKeys) provides a faster login experience while offering the highest level of protection against session hijacking.

**2. Protecting the Promises Made to Customers**
- Infrastructural Integrity: Rain’s mission is to make stablecoins usable in the real world; this requires absolute trust. Our security foundation protects the integrity of every transaction by ensuring that internal access is audited, least-privileged, and resilient to malicious actors.

- Audit-Readiness by Default: By using Microsoft Purview for automated compliance logging, we ensure that as Rain grows, the "proof of security" is always ready for regulators, preventing growth-stalling audit cycles.

**3. Empowering the IT Team**
- Eliminating Toil: We prioritize JML (Joiner-Mover-Leaver) Automation to remove manual, repetitive tasks from the IT team's plate. This allows the team to focus on high-value projects like security architecture and scaling global operations.

- Culture of Ownership: I empower my team by providing clear Best Practice Documentation and the autonomy to fix what’s broken without waiting.
